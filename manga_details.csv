*No, wasn't that just for playing house?*

Every time she refuses his marriage proposal, he gently hugs her around the waist, and asks in a cold voice, ""Did your taste change while I was away?""

Lexion's eyes were full of life as he asked.

It was as if when he found out who her type was, he'd kill them right away.

He is almost always accompanied by his best friend Saitou Takaki, who is also constantly harassed.  
  
As the pair grow increasingly tired of being victimized they decide to join the titular Karate Club, which is notorious throughout Osaka's youth gangs for training and producing the city's most hardened and toughest teenage thugs while maintaining the facade of a legit school sports club. But when they join the club, they find themselves picked on just as much if not worse by the club's current members. But as the story progresses they grow to be increasingly capable fighters.  
  
Along with the manga's change in attitude and central character, the various teenage fighters throughout the series grew increasingly stronger and even began to tap into superhuman ki abilities, putting Osu!! Karate Bu in the company of other similar epic Shōnen fighting manga such as Yu Yu Hakusho, Dragon Ball, and Fist of the North Star.  
  
Osu!! Karate Bu was wildly popular in its native Japan, but is otherwise almost completely unknown in most other countries. It spawned a four episode OVA mini-series released over a period of two years from 1990-1992, a 1990 live action movie, and a 1994 Super Famicom fighting game.","Thriller, Action, Psychological, Comedy, Sports, Martial Arts, Philosophical, Drama, School Life, Slice of Life",8.0833,453,1985

In the year 2020, Earth’s magnetic poles disappeared and humankind was nearly wiped out by cosmic radiation. Within the span of a hundred years, living creatures began to mutate and devour each other while the remaining humans, numbering in the tens of thousands, struggled bitterly in their man-made bases.

In the Abyss, home to the mutated xenogenics, there lived a sentient little mushroom. Because it had been nourished by the blood and flesh of the deceased human An Ze, not only did it take on a similar-looking human form, but a similar name as well: An Zhe.

An Zhe is determined to go to the human base to search for his spore, which had been harvested by humans. Once there, however, he faces the omnipresent risk of discovery and certain death as he tries to keep his non-human nature hidden from the Judges, whose responsibility is to inspect for and eliminate xenogenics like himself. And of all the Judges, Colonel Lu Feng is the most perceptive and merciless—as soon as he determines that someone is a xenogenic, he will execute that person on the spot.

But An Zhe’s mutation goes undetected by Lu Feng’s eyes, and so a tale of humans and xenogenics unfolds…

Ah~ I don’t know!! For now, let’s start by conquering the male characters!

“I already have a promised marriage.""

“I volunteered for the Western Guard. We won’t be able to meet for several years.”
What is this, is this really a romance fantasy novel? Why is everyone running away?!
In the first place… was I really transmigrated as the female lead?

What kind of novel is this!!!!

**Notes:**
- The original Japanese title contains the manji symbol, so it will not be removed from the title on MangaDex.
- Addendum on the ""Manji"" for those uninformed. From Seven Seas' Omnibus Edition:
  *""In East Asia the manji (卍) is an ancient religious symbol of power and good fortune for many different countries and religions around the world, including Buddhism, Hinduism, Jainism, and a number of Indo-European and Native American religions as well.""* 
*""The specific meaning of the symbol varies by nation and religion, and also by the position of the ""arms"" of the cross--whether they face left or right, or whether the cross is tilted or straight.""* 
*""In the 1930s, the swastika symbol--a clockwise, tilted cross--was adopted by the Nazi Political Party in Germany, and gained a negative reputation as a symbol of hatred in the modern world.""*
*""The manji used by the Tokyo Manji Gang as their emblem is intended to be the ancient Buddhist symbol, as evidenced by the appearance of its counterclockwise, straight arms...""*

“Kamen Rider SPIRITS” is a manga series adapted from the famous Kamen Rider series with content focusing on the first 10 Kamen Riders in Japan's Showa period (Showa) and their battle with the Badan Empire under with the help of a multi-governmental task force called “SPIRITS”. The manga's setting takes place immediately after the Kamen Rider Super-1 series, and is different from the TV Special ""Birth of the 10th! Kamen Riders All Together!!"" in 1984.

In particular, this manga also contributes to supplementing and correcting missing details in the original series such as why Riderman is still alive after the Pluton warhead explosion in the series ""Kamen Rider V3"", or why Electronic Wave Humanoid Tackle was never recognized as a Kamen Rider. Initially, the series was published in the manga magazine ""Magazine Z"" and had to stop for a while because ""Magazine Z"" decided to cancel publication. Later, the manga was revived by ""Monthly Shounen Magazine"" under the name ""Shin Kamen Rider SPIRITS"" and continues to be published to this day.

Since volume 3, Shin Kamen Rider Spirits has been published with a special edition, comes with a rare cover, and a separate volume of colorized version for a specific arc in the manga. The first arc which was fully colored was chapter 1 from the original run (""Skyscraper's Gale"").

""Ah, that’s true.""

It all began during our academy days.
I was exhausted from the constant stream of marriage proposals.

‘What about me?’
‘What?’
‘As your marriage partner.’

But as time passed,
and when the end of the contract was approaching…

""Soon, I'll be free!""

I thought the embarrassing couple act would soon be over! But…

—Clank.

I stared, bewildered, at the handcuffs now on both my wrist and Aivert’s.

***

I thought we’d just be stuck together, and as long as we did our part, everything would be fine.

After all, acting as a couple would get easier, right?

I kept thinking positively about it, but…

Holding the key to the handcuffs,
Aivert Royden subtly tilted his head.

“If I break this, would you be disappointed?”

To Die In June,"Author's Notes:  
  
Whether it’s wanting to kill someone  
or being in a time when people die,  
death makes really good material for a story,  
so I set out to draw “a manga where people enjoy dying.” Not that it’s enjoyable.  
This grew out of a piece I did for the group exhibition “Seira Fuku Kyouten” (Sailor Uniform Scriptures) held in Osaka, “Umi Yukaba”. I just couldn’t forget about the anachronous girls in uniform.  
  
Like a painter depicting love, death, war, and faith, I felt like I wandered off all of those themes. And so I’ve put all of those into this work. What makes up the core of this story are themes like girlhood and motherhood, birth and loss, and various beliefs.  
  
Much like my previous “La Sagrada Familia”, I put together a squad of 12 girl soldiers. Their names are inspired by suicide weapons and the calendar months. (For example Satsukibara Nae is taken from Satsuki(Naezuki) which means May)  
I drew the boat in the middle using a plastic model.  
  
What’s a girl riding in the woman boat on the mother ocean? A girl, that’s all!  
Please enjoy this story, of naive girls who haven’t yet discovered themselves, of love and war and revolution. And I would be delighted if you could watch over their battle until the very end.","Girls' Love, Drama, Tragedy",8.8,825,2016

“Is this truly reality? Did I really travel back to the past?”

This was neither a dream nor a hallucination. This feeling of hunger, fatigue, the vivid sense of everything around her… This was all real. If this was indeed reality… If God truly gave her one more precious chance…!

‘I’m going to carry out a business. A marriage is a business in the end. Zachary’s child will be the perfect source of financial support. I’m sure my dowry will remain safe too. I won’t have to lose the Blanchefort or Arno territories to that damned viscount either.’

“How much was my dowry exactly?”

“400 calves, 900 pigs, 100 units of silverware, 300 rolls of silk, 2 crates of jewels, and a portion of a territory… Equivalent to a two-year budget for the Arno county.”

“Don’t you think you should compensate for that?”

With untold riches up for the taking, it gives birth to a gigantic treasure hunt.
However, Kodornacht hides something much more important and mysterious: The Phantom Court—a trinket with the power to control winds, fortune, and, some say, even resurrect the dead. 

The Hunt begins.
